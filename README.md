This was a project for my Senior Project class at UCMO.
We used Angular, Serverless, and AWS to create a training request site with the industry partner Risen One.
I primarily worked front end and worked closely with other team members to get the back-end making sense.

Due to time limits and having a lot of difficulty getting the technologies set up initially, we were put behind and did not complete the project to the extent we hoped to.
Some functionality still lacks.
I am very proud of the project and enjoyed working with my team!

Accomplishments include learning how to write and hit APIs, using AWS DynamoDB to contain our backend, and working on a team project.
I learned a lot about Angular and how to connect front to back end. 
I worked closely with our back end team to understand how AWS worked.
We used Git for version control and sharing code. I primarily worked from Git Bash but occassionally used GitHub in Chrome as well.
